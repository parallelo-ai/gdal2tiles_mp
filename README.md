# gdal2tiles_mp

## Description

Bringing `multiprocessing` to [gdal2tiles.py](http://www.gdal.org/gdal2tiles.html)
for improving the speed for tile generation. This code is built upon the
command line tool `gdal2tiles.py` provided by [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org).  
This code was inspired on `gdal2tiles_parallel.py` of the project
[https://github.com/GitHubRGI/geopackage-python](https://github.com/GitHubRGI/geopackage-python/blob/master/Tiling/gdal2tiles_parallel.py)

The image `USA_IFR_Low_Alaska_RESIZE.tif` is available at [https://github.com/roblabs/gdal2tilesp](https://github.com/roblabs/gdal2tilesp)
and it will be useful for testing purposes.
